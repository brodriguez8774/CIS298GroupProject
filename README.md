# Mobile Group Project: Investigating Broadcom & Internet of Things

## Author

Jeffrey Martin, Brandon Rodriguez

## Description

An attempt to learn about "Internet of Things" concepts with hands-on development, using Broadcom's "WICED SMART"" pre-made mobile application as a base.

Broadcam's sensor associated with the application can detect a number of things including: Device orientation, speed, compass direction, air pressure, humidity, and temperature.

### Core Function and Minimum Implementation

Our goal is to learn how the program connects to the device (including finding out how the bluetooth conectivity works, if time allows). From there, we will create our own UI, showcasing that we understand how to read the sensor information and accurately display it in real time.

### Additional functionality, should time allow

Determine a way to store up to a week's worth of data within the app. We will average out the information so that we only store the hourly-average per data type. Any hours with no sensory information will display as "NA" or some equivalent. This data will then be displayed to a clean and easy to read UI. This UI will display both "current data" plus have a tab to show specifics of each data catagory.

Should we accomplish this, we can take it a step further by showing something along the lines of "change this week." For example, we could do "Total distance traveled" or "Highest Temperature Vs Lowest Temperature" type displays.

### Notes

It might be beneficial to look into a few resources before we start any actual work.

For example, we might want to consider some practices for commenting and organization:
* Javadocs  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/index-137868.html
* Use of regions  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2344524/java-equivalent-to-region-in-c-sharp


We could also investigate how to properly create commit messages and decide on a standard:
